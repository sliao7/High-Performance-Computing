0, login the coc by running:
ssh sliao7@coc-ice.pace.gatech.edu

1, Upload and download file to coc: Go to the direction of the file and run the following code locally

Upload:
lawn-128-61-4-39:mpi-proj liaoshasha$ scp jacobi.cpp sliao7@coc-ice.pace.gatech.edu:~

Download:
scp sliao7@coc-ice.pace.gatech.edu:timeArray.txt /Users/liaoshasha/mpi-proj

2, After that, in coc, we can run the cpp file we just uploaded by setting parameters in this way:
qsub -I -q coc-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=16,mem=2gb,walltime=01:00:00
# Here we set nodes*ppn number of processors

Wait for a moment in a line!

3, After that, we need to load the modules:
module load gcc mvapich2/2.2

4, Compile the cpp codes:
mpicxx prog1.cpp -o prog1

5, Run the compiled file:
mpirun -np 16 ./prog1
# here 16 is the number of processors

6, To run the prog1.cpp in cluster, just need to run the following codes in the terminal
dos2unix bash.pbs
qsub 1000A36A5A.pbs

7, To check the process of the job
checkjob -v job_id
